The name of my project is “Speedy Diner!”. This project is a game where the
user has to go back and forth between the kitchen and the dining room to
seat customers and maximize how many points you get by giving them their food
in the least amount of time. The customers will come in sets of 4 and each group
has a separate name. When you seat a group at a table, they're order will appear
in the ticket bar at the bottom of the screen and ticket will only vanish once
you have completed their order. Certain orders require you to use the cooking
pan (for the steak and the spring rolls) whereas other orders, you simply
move to the station and wait for the item to finish cooking. If there are 3
customers waiting outside, the game is over.

To run the game, load the runGame.py file.

There are no libraries that need to be installed for this project and
there are no shortcut commands.
